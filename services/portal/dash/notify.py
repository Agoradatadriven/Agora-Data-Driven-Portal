"""Optional, graceful notifications for Agora Atrium (mirrors feedback_ai.py).

There is no email capability in the portal yet, and we do not stand one up speculatively. By
DEFAULT every notification simply:
  * records an activity entry in the client's workspace (so the event shows in "Recent activity"), and
  * logs a line to stdout.

IF an email provider is later configured -- gated on an env flag AND a Secret-Manager-mounted key,
with the provider SDK imported LAZILY -- the same calls also send an email. An unconfigured deploy
can never break, because email is strictly optional (exactly the pattern feedback_ai.py uses for
the Anthropic SDK). No provider key is committed.

Enable real email by setting BOTH:
  * ATRIUM_EMAIL_ENABLED=1
  * ATRIUM_EMAIL_API_KEY=<provider key>     (mount from Secret Manager via env at deploy time)
Team inbox: ATRIUM_TEAM_EMAIL (default info@agoradatadriven.com).

Direction of travel:
  * client -> team   (approve / request-changes / send-message): notify the AGORA inbox.
  * team   -> client (add content / reply): notify the client, but ONLY recipients whose
                      Notification-settings toggles allow it (the master switch wins).
