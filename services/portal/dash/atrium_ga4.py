"""Live GA4 event counts for the Atrium 'Website Health' tab (team-only, OPT-IN).

`fetch_event_counts(property_id)` calls the **Google Analytics Data API** (`runReport`) for a GA4
property and returns the per-event counts over a recent window -- so the Website Health tab can show
how many times `page_view`, `session_start`, `purchase`, etc. actually fired (real numbers from
Google, NOT something the HTML tag-scan can know).

Where this differs from `atrium_health.detect_tags` (which only reads the page HTML, no infra): this
reads REAL analytics data, so it needs auth + the Data API. It is therefore a **deliberate, opt-in
deviation** from Atrium's "no new infra" rule -- it stays dormant unless `GA4_REPORTING_ENABLED=1`,
mirroring the Drive-API strategy feature and the signed-upload feature.

Keyless auth (no key file, mirroring `workspace.signed_upload_url`): the runtime SA holds
`roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` on ITSELF (granted by `enable_atrium_uploads.ps1` /
`enable_ga4_reporting.ps1`). A cloud-platform ADC token is used to call the IAM Credentials
`generateAccessToken` API, minting a short-lived `analytics.readonly`-scoped token for the Data API.
(A plain Cloud Run token is cloud-platform-scoped only, which the Data API rejects.) The SA must also
be added as a **Viewer** on each client's GA4 property (a per-client step in GA4 Admin) -- until then
the API returns 403 and this degrades to a friendly "grant access" message, never a 500.

Pure + testable: all network/auth lives in `_default_runner`; `fetch_event_counts` accepts a `runner`
injection so unit tests run with canned API JSON and no network. Every failure is caught and returned
as a result whose `ok` is False with a human-readable `error` -- it never raises. `requests` /
`google.auth` are imported lazily.
