"""Registry store -- CRUD over the portal's ONE private JSON document (no database).

The portal's entire state lives in a single private GCS object:
    bucket  agora-data-driven-platform-dash
    object  platform.json
This module reads/writes that document and resolves portal logins. It is the only code that touches
the registry shape defined in config.py.

Password model (resolve ORDER for verify_portal_login):
  1. SUPER-ADMIN: env SUPER_ADMIN_PW (mounted from Secret Manager `platform-super-admin-password`
     by tools/enable_super_admin.ps1). Matching this grants god-mode ("*", all clients).
  2. ACCOUNTS: a real per-user email+password account in platform.json (the `accounts` list). Login
     matches EMAIL + password; only an `active` account authenticates (a `pending` sign-up does not).
     An account carries a role ("admin" -> clients ["*"]; "client" -> its own client keys). This is
     the modern path -- accounts are created by self-service sign-up (status "pending", approved by an
     admin) or seeded directly (e.g. the dev@localhost admin). See the account CRUD below.
  3. REGISTRY: a per-client pbkdf2_hmac hash stored in platform.json (set via set_client_password).
     This is the legacy/demo path -- it matches a PASSWORD to a client regardless of the email typed.
  4. BOOTSTRAP: env PORTAL_BOOTSTRAP_PW -- a fallback so the very first login works before any
     registry password has been set. Unset it once real passwords exist.

Recoverable-plaintext trade-off (DELIBERATE):
  Alongside each pbkdf2 hash we ALSO keep the plaintext (`pw_plain`) in the registry. This is a
  conscious security trade-off: it lets the super-admin console REVEAL a client's portal password
  (reveal_password) so an operator can read it back to a client who lost it -- a CRM/helpdesk need.
  The registry object is PRIVATE (never public, bucket is not world-readable), so the plaintext
  never leaves the trust boundary; but anyone with read access to platform.json can see passwords.
  If that ever becomes unacceptable, drop `pw_plain` and reveal_password() degrades to "unavailable"
  while verify_portal_login keeps working off the pbkdf2 hash alone.

All password comparisons use hmac.compare_digest (constant-time); hashes use hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac.
