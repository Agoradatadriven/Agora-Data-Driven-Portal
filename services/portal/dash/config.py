"""Seed data for the portal registry (platform.json).

This module holds the INITIAL contents of the registry that `seed_registry.py` writes into the
private GCS object `agora-data-driven-platform-dash/platform.json` -- the ONE source of truth for
the portal. There is no database; the registry is a single JSON document and these dicts are its
first snapshot.

What is here at standup:
  * The sole agency, `agora` ("Agora Data Driven"). Its client list starts EMPTY -- clients are
    added later through the portal admin/super-admin UI, not hand-edited here.
  * NO seeded clients. The registry starts with an empty client list; real clients are created
    through the Workspaces console (/admin/atrium/new -> onboard_client), which appends entries of
    the shape documented below. (We used to seed a placeholder `template` client; it was a stand-in
    with no real workspace, so it is no longer seeded -- a fresh portal starts clean.)

Naming derivation (kept consistent with the rest of the monorepo, derived from a client key `<c>`):
  * subdomain:    <c>.agoradatadriven.com
  * dash service: <c>-dash            (Cloud Run service)
  * password secret (upstream dash):  <c>-dash-password   (resolved by store.get_client_dash_password)

These are plain dicts on purpose: `seed_registry.py` consumes them as-is and `store.py` reads/writes
the same shape over GCS. Keep them serialisable (no objects, no callables).
