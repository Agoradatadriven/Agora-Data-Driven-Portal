"""Optional AI enrichment of portal feedback (transcription + summarisation).

This module is DELIBERATELY a graceful no-op unless explicitly configured. The portal must deploy
and run with no AI wired at all: feedback is always stored verbatim by feedback.py, and these
functions simply return None when the enrichment is not enabled. That keeps the LLM strictly
optional -- there is NO hard dependency on the `anthropic` package, so an unconfigured deploy
cannot break.

Enable enrichment by setting BOTH:
  * FEEDBACK_AI_ENABLED=1            -- the on/off guard
  * ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<key>         -- the Anthropic API key (read by the SDK from the env)
When wired, the LLM calls use the Anthropic Claude API with model id "claude-opus-4-8".

Each function returns the enrichment string on success, or None when disabled / on any error
(so a failed enrichment never blocks storing the raw feedback).
