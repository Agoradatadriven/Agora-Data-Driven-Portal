"""Portal / CRM front-door for Agora Data Driven (Cloud Run service `platform-dash`).

What this is:
  ONE Cloud Run service at portal.agoradatadriven.com that is (a) a single login over every
  client dashboard and (b) a reverse proxy that serves each dashboard under /d/<client>/...
  behind that single login. It is designed to GROW INTO A CRM: the registry is one private JSON
  in GCS (agora-data-driven-platform-dash/platform.json) and the `# CRM:` markers below show
  where client records, notes, and tasks attach as the portal expands.

Auth model (two cooperating layers):
  1. Portal session -- a signed Flask session cookie set on successful /login.
  2. SSO -- on login the portal ALSO mints the shared .agoradatadriven.com-scoped cookie via
     platform_sso.mint_sso_cookie. That cookie is presented to every <c>.agoradatadriven.com
     dashboard so a portal login is trusted additively (each dashboard's own password still works).

Reverse proxy (/d/<client>/...):
  The portal logs into the upstream <client>-dash service ONCE, server-side, using that dash's own
  Secret-Manager password (store.get_client_dash_password), holds the upstream session in a cookie
  jar, and proxies requests/responses. It injects a small logout pill + feedback widget into proxied
  HTML so the user always has a way back to the portal. This means the end user only ever types the
  PORTAL password -- they never see the per-dashboard password.

Org policy forbids public Cloud Run: deploy with --no-invoker-iam-check (never
--allow-unauthenticated); this app does its OWN auth in-process.
