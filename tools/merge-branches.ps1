# merge-branches.ps1 -- integrate the per-machine dev branches, land them on main,
#                       and DEPLOY every changed service to live. One command, end to
#                       end. The agent (Claude Code) is the human-in-the-loop: this
#                       script does the deterministic, mechanical work and STOPS for the
#                       agent only where judgment is needed (a real merge conflict, a red
#                       test). Everything else -- land + auto-detect-and-deploy + prune --
#                       is automatic.
#
# == AGENT RUNBOOK (read this when a developer drops this file into Claude Code) =======
#   The team SOP is: a developer pastes the path to this script into Claude Code and asks
#   you to "merge + deploy". You (the agent) DRIVE THE WHOLE PIPELINE TO LIVE:
#
#     1. Run it:   .\tools\merge-branches.ps1
#        (optionally .\tools\merge-branches.ps1 -DryRun FIRST to print the land+deploy
#         plan and change nothing -- good when you're unsure what will ship.)
#
#     2. If it STOPS on a MERGE CONFLICT: it has aborted that one branch's merge and left
#        the clean merges on `integration/merge`. Open the conflicting files, resolve them
#        SEMANTICALLY -- preserve BOTH developers' intent (e.g. two people who rebuilt the
#        same screen); never just pick one side blindly -- commit the resolution, then
#        re-run this script. It will pick up from a clean state.
#
#     3. If it STOPS on a RED CI TEST: the integrated tree fails a gate. Fix the failure
#        (on the integration result), then re-run. NEVER bypass the tests or land a red tree.
#
#     4. On success it has ALREADY: landed `integration/merge` into `main` (fast-forward,
#        pushed), deployed every service whose files changed (see the mapping below), and
#        pruned the dev branches now contained in `main`. Report to the developer exactly
#        which services deployed and to which URLs.
#
#   You are the only "judgment" in the loop -- the script never auto-resolves a conflict
#   and never lands or deploys a tree that failed CI. Do not work around those stops.
# =====================================================================================
#
# WHAT IT DOES (default, no flags):
#   0. if your working tree has local changes, commit + push them to THIS machine's own
#      dev branch first (delegates to push-branch.ps1) so your work is integrated too.
#   1. fetch + discover every per-machine branch on origin (everything except main).
#   2. create a throwaway `integration/merge` branch off origin/main.
#   3. merge each branch in turn -- on the FIRST conflict it aborts that merge and STOPS
#      (hand off to the agent per the runbook above).
#   4. run the CI tests locally against the integrated result; STOP if anything is red.
#   5. LAND: fast-forward `main` to the integrated result and push origin main.
#   6. DEPLOY: diff the integrated result against the old main, map each changed path to
#      its deploy script, and run each (build-as-yourself -> gcloud run deploy). See the
#      path -> deploy-script mapping in Resolve-DeployPlan below.
#   7. PRUNE: delete the remote dev branches whose commits are now contained in origin/main
#      (safe by construction -- it can never drop unmerged work).
#
# FLAGS (opt out of pieces of the pipeline):
#   -DryRun        do steps 1-4 locally, then PRINT the land + deploy + prune plan and
#                  change NOTHING on origin or in production. (Reflects COMMITTED branches;
#                  commit/push local WIP first to see it in the plan.)
#   -NoPush        integrate + test, then STOP before landing (the old review-first
#                  behavior). Prints the manual land/deploy commands.
#   -NoDeploy      land to main, but do NOT deploy the changed services (deploy later).
#   -NoPrune       skip the branch cleanup at the end.
#   -Exclude a,b   skip specific dev branches (comma-separated).
#   -DeleteMerged  standalone: ONLY prune remote branches already contained in origin/main
#                  (runs nothing else). Unchanged from the original tool.
